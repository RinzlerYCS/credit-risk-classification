Loan Risk Prediction - Machine Learning Analysis

Overview of the Analysis

This analysis aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan is healthy (0) or high-risk (1) based on several financial factors. The goal is to help the company make better lending decisions by identifying potential high-risk loans.

Results

Below are the key performance metrics of the Logistic Regression model:

Accuracy Score: 99%

Precision Score:

Healthy loans (0): 1.00

High-risk loans (1): 0.86

Recall Score:

Healthy loans (0): 0.99

High-risk loans (1): 0.94

F1-Score:

Healthy loans (0): 1.00

High-risk loans (1): 0.90

Confusion Matrix

Summary

The Logistic Regression model performed exceptionally well, achieving an overall accuracy of 99%. It is highly effective at predicting healthy loans, but has some difficulty in precisely identifying high-risk loans. Specifically:

The precision for high-risk loans (1) is 0.86, meaning that 14% of the loans predicted as high-risk were actually healthy.

The recall for high-risk loans (1) is 0.94, indicating that 6% of actual high-risk loans were misclassified as healthy
